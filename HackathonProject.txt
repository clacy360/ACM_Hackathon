Theme: In-Person Entertainment

Idea: The current UWB Events website does not differentiate events between faculty and students.
      This makes it difficult to reach both student and staff through independent channels.
      Our goal was to create a separate site that focused soley on upcoming student events.

Project Goals:
1) Use Figma to generate website UI
2) Implement website through VSCode
3) Divide Website 

Desired User Experience:
1) User navigates to UWB main website
2) UWB main website links to Events page to view featured and upcoming events

Implementation Details:
1) Download ASP.NET SDK files to run through "dotnet watch" command
2) Shared GitHub Repository to implement features
3) Divided work of 5 main pages between 5 members

Future Work:
1) Integrate UWB calendar student events to to connect to front-end interface
2) Additional searching/filtering features 
3) Set up daily/weekly email reminders
4) Host website on server with loadable link
5) Maintainable code through GitHub(potential errors presently)
